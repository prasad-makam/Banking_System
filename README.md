# Banking_System


# INTRODUCTION

  This banking system project is aimed at providing an automated
system for banks for maintaining their ledger record and for generating
reports and transactions in a very fast and efficient manner. The use
of computerized management systems is becoming very popular
because they are very accurate and they compute and sort and
display the data in the way the user wants to see it . We would like to
do the same for a bank to meet their business requirements.

  The banking system project will help the banks to maintain their
records and their transactions in the database. The data can be
stored. Banking provides reports will be displayed for the staff which
will help them to do their work very efficiently and quickly. The
management of the bank will be simplified to a great extent.

# INTRODUCTION TO SYSTEM

  System can be modified and using different tools it can be made
as a real time banking application .Presently the records are
maintained in registers and manually entered. The records can be
updated daily and the calculations are performed by the accountant.
The transactions can be made by referring to the various registers and
papers maintained by the banks. Preparing reports is a tedious
process for the clerk.

by asking for an account number and then the amount to
